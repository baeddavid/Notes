* Language Processors
** A compiler is a program that can read a program in one language -- the source language -- and translate it into an equivalent program in another language -- the target language.
*** Source Program --> [Compiler] --> Target Program
** An interpreter is another common kind of language processor. Instead of producing a target program as a translation, an interpreter appears to directly execute the operations specified in the source program on inputs supplied by the user.
*** Source Program AND Input --> [Interpter] --> Output
